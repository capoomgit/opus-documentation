# Change Log

All changes to OPUS are documented here.

## [0.2.3] - 2023-08-11

### Added

- Introducing support for multi-floor buildings, including Apartment and Shop structures.
- OpenStreetMap (OSM) houses are now randomly assigned as Apartments, Shops, or Houses. Further control over this feature will be available in future versions.
- Introducing the Road structure, enabling the generation of random road networks with XODR and FBX output formats. An in-depth documentation can be found in [here](https://github.com/capoomgit/opus-documentation/blob/main/ROAD_SUPPORTS.md) and Unreal Engine (UE) materials for roads can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Atb2ruYV8VV1gaxbHxaSskNyZ4YGbnSY/view?usp=sharing).
- Implemented a color system for materials, enhancing visual variety across our structures.
- Added the new `/get_attributes_with_name` endpoint that has more comprehensive result. More information can be found here.
- Improved error messaging for client-side errors, addressing previously ambiguous cases.

### Changed

- The extension list is now a mandatory field for `/create_house_with_floor_input`, `/create_opus_structure`, and `/create_opus_component` endpoints.

### Fixed

- Resolved a bug related to parameters being provided outside their valid ranges.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-06-16

### Added

-`/create_house_with_floor_input` endpoint has been added to create houses with footprints from the given OSM file. These houses can optionally be placed onto the terrain provided by the user. A tutorial for this endpoint can be found in OPUSOSM file.

- Added I/O support for .glb, .gltf and .fbx file extensions to all of the generation endpoints. (FBX currently does not support transparent materials such as glass)
- Added output of all parameters in a JSON file called `opus_output.json`.
- Added `/create_opus_batch_component` and `/create_opus_batch_structure` endpoints that will create X amount of structures and components with one call. (There is a maximum limit of 10 in this version.)

### Changed

-`/create_house_with_floor_input` and batch job endpoints will now return a list of results from the `/get_opus_job_result` endpoint. Warnings will be also provided upon submitting a `/create_house_with_floor_input` job, if there are any.

### Fixed

- Handled invalid/empty job ids that were throwing an internal server error.
- Fixed cases where GarageDoor, Stair, Mailbox, and Antenna assets were sometimes giving empty outputs.
- Fixed the cases where window had no materials on some part of the model.
- Resolved an issue causing job failure when parameters contained empty or invalid keys.
- Introduced an error message for instances when the specified parameter does not exist.
